# Croppie
The project’s app, Croppie, will gamify real-time photo data collection from smallholders by incentivizing PhotoCropping, i.e. taking and sharing photos of their crops to:

Generate low-cost, high volumes of real-time primary data from smallholder farmers that support AI/ML model training;
Cost-effectively empowering smallholders with predictive AI-generated yield insights in actionable formats, for more effective planning, improved risk management, and increased resilience.


In this repository are all the modeling tools for the croppie project.
